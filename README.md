This is a terminal version of one of my favorite games growing up

## Chopsticks

# Basics
- 2 Players
- Goal: Using hits or transfers (what I call the possible moves), you want to bring your opponent's hand to exactly 5 points (fingers) knocking out that hand. You want to do this to both hands and once both of your opponents hands are 'DEAD', you win !

# How to play
1. Each player starts with 2 fingers out on each hand (fingers represent points)
2. Players take turns in making moves. The two possible moves are: 
    - Hits: Using one of your hands. Attack one of the opponents hand. The opponent's hand now has the sum of points from the attacking hand and the attacked hand. Ex. Attacker (has 2 points/fingers) hits the opponents hand (has 1 point). Opponent now has 3 points on that hand
    - Transfers: Players can choose to change the combination of points they have on each hand by transfering points to their other hand. Ex. (left: 1 point | right: 3 points) -> (left: 2 points | right: 2 points)
3. Players continue until a player wins by knocking out both of the opponent's hands.

# Rules
- Hits: You cannot hit an opponent's hand over 5 points. In order to get their hand out, the attack must make their hand exactly 5 points.
- Transfers: You cannot do transfers if the resulting combination of points on the hands is identical to the original combination but just swapped. Ex. (left: 4 ponts: right: 3 points) -> (left: 3 points | right: 4 points). This is invalid.
